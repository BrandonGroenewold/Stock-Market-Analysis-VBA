# Stock Market Analysis

## Background

To display I have mastered my Excel Skills and showcase VBA skills, I will analyze generated stock market data.


### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final report.

## Steps

I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

**Note:** I have also used conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

My results are in the following image:
